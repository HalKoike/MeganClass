##Chapter 5, Exercise 7
##Katie Lubarsky

##Load arm package
library(arm)

##create data fitting the following specifications (from exercise): single predictor x takes on values 1-20, binary data y.
x<-1:20
y<-c(rep(0,times=10), rep(1, times=10))

data<-data.frame(x,y)

attach(data)

##fit logistic regression to data
fit<-glm(y~x, family=binomial(link="logit"))
display(fit)

##plot data and fitted curve 
plot(x,y)
curve(invlogit(coef(fit)[1]+coef(fit)[2]*x), add=TRUE)

###The model does not fit the data in this case because the predictor is completely aligned with the data, so that y=1 for all cases above a threshold (in this case x=10) and y=0 for all values below the threshold. Therefore, beta is best estimated by positive infinity.
