########## Chapter 5 Question 8 ###############
## I couldn't find the rodent dataset, so I Used the roach dataset instead
## 8a.

roach <- read.csv("C:/Users/Jamie/IDriveSync/MultilevelModels_ReadingGroup/ARM_Data/roaches/roachdata.csv", head=T)
roach$s.roach1 <- scale(roach$roach1)
roach$s.exposure2 <- scale(roach$exposure2)

# check that we get mean of 0 and sd of 1
colMeans(roach[c("s.roach1", "s.exposure2")])  # faster version of apply(scaled.dat, 2, mean)
apply(roach[c("s.roach1", "s.exposure2")], 2, sd)

fit.1 <- glm (roach$treatment ~ roach$s.roach1, family=binomial(link="logit"))
fit.1
plot(fit.1)

# Intercept of 0.41 tells us that a difference in 1 roach exposure 
# category increases the probability of treatment by 41%

## 8b.
fit.2 <- glm(roach$treatment ~ roach$s.roach1 + roach$s.exposure2, family=binomial(link="logit"))
fit.2

# Adding exposure reduced the residual deviance by <1

fit.3 <- glm(roach$treatment ~ roach$s.roach1 + roach$s.exposure2 + roach$s.roach1:roach$s.exposure2,
             family=binomial(link="logit"))
fit.3

# Adding an interaction between exposure and number of roaches reduced the residual deviance slightly

fit.4 <- glm(roach$treatment ~ roach$s.roach1 + roach$s.exposure2 + roach$senior,
             family=binomial(link="logit"))
fit.4

# Adding the senior category improves the residual deviance further. This model tells us that 
# at a mean level of roaches, each unit inrease in roaches increases the probability of 
# treatment by 1% (0.06538/4=0.013845); at the mean level of exposure, the probability
# of treatment is increased by 2% (coef = 0.08351/4 = 0.0208775); seniors are 9% more likely to get 
# roach treatment over individuals that are not senior.
